# Convert Unreal Engine .uasset to Source Engine .mdl

![ue4-to-gmod-demonstration](ue4-to-gmod-demonstration.png)

This guide describes how to convert an asset from Unreal Engine to Source Engine. It was written pretty swiftly so there will be mistakes. Nevertheless it should fulfil it's purpose, allowing you to bring static models over from UE to Source Engine games like Garry's Mod, Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source etc...

The guide can be found as a Word Document (`converting-uasset-to-mdl.docx`) or as a .pdf (`converting-uasset-to-mdl.pdf`)



With the guide come all downloads described in the guide. You can find these in the `dependencies` directory and can use these if the sites mentioned in the guide are offline.



## Requirements

The guide is written with **Windows** in mind, but you can also use **Linux** or **MacOS for parts** of the process.

* Software required:
  * [UModel](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files) *is available for Windows and Linux (only the Windows 32-bit .exe is included)*
  * [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) *is available cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS)*
  * [VTFEdit](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=41) *only works on Windows, but you can use [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to run VTFEdit if you also install the .NET platform within Wine. Alternatively you could use [XnView MP](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/) to manipulate VTF's on Linux. On MacOS [you'll have to improvise](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527715471).*
  * A Source Game to test the model in. *I used Garry's Mod writing this guide. It allows me to easily spawn the model through the prop-menu.*
* Skills required:
  * You have some basic knowledge about Blender, like how to navigate the different options, manipulate on-screen objects and move the camera.
  * You have a lot of patience
  * You track back through the instructions when something fails and try again, more diligently.
  * You re-read everything you type, making sure you make no mistakes.



## Source Limitations

**Roughness map** (included in example assets)

With this guide comes an example that has a Roughness map (or glossiness/smoothness map). Sadly this can not be added with the same simplicity the normal map is added. [This document from the Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Adapting_PBR_Textures_to_Source) describes how to adapt a PBR Roughness map to Source by using a bit of math and a [specular mask](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$envmapmask).
